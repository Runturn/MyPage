### My story

I lived in a small county in northeastern China until I turned 18.  ![image](/assets/img/The path home from school.jpg)

The train ride from home to university covered over 2,000 kilometers, and I spent the entire journey gazing into the future.  ![image](/assets/img/Changjiang.jpg)

Perhaps now is the time to start turning that vision into reality.

Even though the roads turn muddy on snowy days, the crisp and refreshing air makes it all worthwhile. There's a unique charm in watching snowflakes dance through the sky, reminding me that every challenging path still offers moments of beauty and clarity.
